    "# Bedrock Knowledge Base Retrieval and Generation with Reranking\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rerank API in Amazon Bedrock is a new feature that improves the accuracy and relevance of responses in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. It supports reranker models that rank a set of retrieved documents based on their relevance to a user's query, helping to prioritize the most relevant content for response generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key features and use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enhancing RAG applications**: The Rerank API addresses challenges in semantic search, particularly with complex or ambiguous queries. For example, it can help a customer service chatbot focus on return policies rather than shipping guidelines when asked about returning an online purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improving search relevance**: It enables developers to significantly enhance their search relevance and content ranking capabilities, making enterprise-grade search technology more accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimizing context window usage**: By ensuring the most useful information is sent to the foundation model, it potentially reduces costs and improves response accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flexible integration**: The Rerank API can be used independently to rerank documents even if you're not using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Multiple model support**: At launch, it supports Amazon Rerank 1.0 and Cohere Rerank 3.5 models.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Customizable configurations**: Developers can specify additional model configurations as key-value pairs for more tailored reranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rerank API is available in select AWS Regions, including US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo). It can be integrated into existing systems at scale, whether keyword-based or semantic, through a single API call in Amazon Bedrock.\n"
