    "## Create a Knowledge Base with Hierarchical Chunking Strategy\n",
    "#### What will we do in this workshop?\n",
    "1. Create a Knowledgebase (KB) in the vector database.\n",
    "2. We will create a data source for the KB. The data source will be the Amazon Science and 10K documents stored in S3.\n",
    "3. We will ingest the data from S3, use Hierarchical Chunking to chunk the data, generate vector embeddings, and store the chunks and their corresponding vector embeddings in the KB.\n",
    "4. We will then ask some questions and query the KB to return some chunks and inspect relevancy score.\n",
    "<br>Note: We are not sending the query and its chunks to a LLM in this notebook. We will do that in other notebooks."

    "#### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hierarchical Chunking**: Organizes your data into a hierarchical structure, allowing for more granular and efficient retrieval based on the inherent relationships within your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Organizing your data into a hierarchical structure enables your **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** workflow to efficiently navigate and retrieve information from complex, nested datasets. After documents are parsed, the first step is to **chunk** them based on the **parent** and **child chunking size**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parent chunks (higher level)** represent larger segments, such as entire documents or sections.\n",
    "- **Child chunks (lower level)** represent smaller segments, such as paragraphs or sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between parent and child chunks is maintained, allowing for **efficient retrieval and navigation** of the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Retrieval**: The hierarchical structure enables faster and more targeted retrieval of relevant information by first performing a **semantic search** on child chunks and then returning the parent chunk. By replacing child chunks with parent chunks, we provide **larger and more comprehensive context** to the foundation model (FM).\n",
    "- **Context Preservation**: Organizing the corpus hierarchically helps maintain contextual relationships between chunks, ensuring more **coherent and contextually relevant** text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** In hierarchical chunking, **parent chunks** are returned while **search is performed on child chunks**. As a result, you may see **fewer search results**, since one parent can have multiple child chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Best Use Cases**\n",
    "Hierarchical chunking is best suited for **complex documents** with a nested or hierarchical structure, such as:\n",
    "- **Technical manuals**\n",
    "- **Legal documents**\n",
    "- **Academic papers** with complex formatting and nested tables.\n"

The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price.

In addition to the factors discussed in Item 7 of Part II, \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\\u201d and in the risk factors below, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below. Many of the risks discussed below also impact our customers, including third-party sellers, which could indirectly have a material adverse effect on us.     Business and Industry Risks We Face Intense Competition     Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, healthcare, communications, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.     Competition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. \",\n",

These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition to the factors discussed in Item 7 of Part II, \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\\u201d and in the risk factors below, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below. Many of the risks discussed below also impact our customers, including third-party sellers, which could indirectly have a material adverse effect on us.     Business and Industry Risks We Face Intense Competition     Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.     Competition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. \",\n",
