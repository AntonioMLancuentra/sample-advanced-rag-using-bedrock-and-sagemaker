    "#### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hierarchical Chunking**: Organizes your data into a hierarchical structure, allowing for more granular and efficient retrieval based on the inherent relationships within your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Organizing your data into a hierarchical structure enables your **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** workflow to efficiently navigate and retrieve information from complex, nested datasets. After documents are parsed, the first step is to **chunk** them based on the **parent** and **child chunking size**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parent chunks (higher level)** represent larger segments, such as entire documents or sections.\n",
    "- **Child chunks (lower level)** represent smaller segments, such as paragraphs or sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between parent and child chunks is maintained, allowing for **efficient retrieval and navigation** of the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Retrieval**: The hierarchical structure enables faster and more targeted retrieval of relevant information by first performing a **semantic search** on child chunks and then returning the parent chunk. By replacing child chunks with parent chunks, we provide **larger and more comprehensive context** to the foundation model (FM).\n",
    "- **Context Preservation**: Organizing the corpus hierarchically helps maintain contextual relationships between chunks, ensuring more **coherent and contextually relevant** text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** In hierarchical chunking, **parent chunks** are returned while **search is performed on child chunks**. As a result, you may see **fewer search results**, since one parent can have multiple child chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Best Use Cases**\n",
    "Hierarchical chunking is best suited for **complex documents** with a nested or hierarchical structure, such as:\n",
    "- **Technical manuals**\n",
    "- **Legal documents**\n",
    "- **Academic papers** with complex formatting and nested tables.\n"

Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided     to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. The effect on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2023          As Reported     Exchange Rate     Effect (1)     At Prior Year     Rates (2) As     Reported     Exchange Rate     Effect (1)     At Prior Year     Rates (2)     Net sales $ 513,983 $ 15,495 $ 529,478 $ 574,785 $ 71 $ 574,856 Operating expenses 501,735 16,356 518,091 537,933 531 538,464 Operating income 12,248 (861) 11,387 36,852 (460) 36,392     ___________________ (1) Represents the change in reported amounts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for     operating results.

These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\\u2019s expectations as of February 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, \\u201cRisk Factors.\\u201d     First Quarter 2024 Guidance \\u2022 Net sales are expected to be between $138.0 billion and $143.5 billion, or to grow between 8% and 13% compared with first quarter 2023. This     guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 40 basis points from foreign exchange rates.     \\u2022 Operating income is expected to be between $8.0 billion and $12.0 billion, compared with $4.8 billion in first quarter 2023. This guidance includes approximately $0.9 billion lower depreciation expense due to an increase in the estimated useful life of our servers beginning on January 1, 2024.     \\u2022 This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.     31Table of Contents     Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \\u2014 Liquidity and Capital Resources.\\u201d     Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt. Our long-term debt is carried at     amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our long-term debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.     We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities. Marketable debt securities with fixed interest rates may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2023 (in millions, except percentages):     2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total     Estimated Fair Value as of     December 31, 2023     Money market funds $ 39,160 $ \\u2014 $ \\u2014 $ \\u2014 $ \\u2014 $ \\u2014 $ 39,160 $ 39,160 Weighted average interest rate 5.32 % \\u2014 % \\u2014 % \\u2014 % \\u2014 % \\u2014 % 5.32 %     Corporate debt securities 25,075 2,227 715 9 \\u2014 \\u2014 28,026 27,805 Weighted average interest rate 5.13 % 1.30 % 1.51 % 2.33 % \\u2014 % \\u2014 % 4.74 %     U.S. government and agency securities 552 501 398 50 43 230 1,774 1,699 Weighted average interest rate 3.24 % 1.49 % 1.12 % 0.97 % 0.67 % 1.31 % 1.89 %     Asset-backed securities 789 349 115 143 13 291 1,700 1,646 Weighted average interest rate 1.34 % 2.09 % 1.20 % 1.67 % 1.66 % 1.33 % 1.51 %     Foreign government and agency securities 506 \\u2014 \\u2014 \\u2014 \\u2014 \\u2014 506 505     Weighted average interest rate 5.28 % \\u2014 % \\u2014 % \\u2014 % \\u2014 % \\u2014 % 5.28 % Other debt securities 62 46 \\u2014 \\u2014 \\u2014 \\u2014 108 104     Weighted average interest rate 0.55 % 1.07 % \\u2014 % \\u2014 % \\u2014 % \\u2014 % 0.78 % $ 66,144 $ 3,123 $ 1,228 $ 202 $ 56 $ 521 $ 71,274     Cash equivalents and marketable debt securities $ 70,919     As of December 31, 2023, we had long-term debt with a face value of $67.2 billion, including the current portion, primarily consisting of fixed rate unsecured senior notes.
