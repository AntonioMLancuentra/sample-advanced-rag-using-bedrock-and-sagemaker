    "# Retrieval and Generation with Bedrock Foundational Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview  \n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to perform retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using Amazon Bedrock's foundational models. It covers retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base and generating responses based on the retrieved context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build your own Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system\n",
    "When constructing your own retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system, you can leverage a retriever system and a generator system. The retriever can be an embedding model that identifies the relevant chunks from the vector database based on similarity scores. The generator can be a Large Language Model (LLM) that utilizes the model's capability to answer questions based on the retrieved results (also known as chunks). In the following sections, we will provide additional tips on how to optimize the prompts for your RAG system."

    "### Importance of Prompt Engineering\n",
    "Prompt engineering refers to the practice of optimizing textual input to a large language model (LLM) to improve output and receive the responses you want. Prompting helps an LLM perform a wide variety of tasks, including classification, question answering, code generation, creative writing, and more. The quality of prompts that you provide to a LLM can impact the quality of the model's responses. <br/>\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Useful techniques to improve prompts for Amazon Nova models\n",
    "Please refer [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/nova/latest/userguide/prompting.html) for the best practice of prompt engineering with Amazon Nova models. Fllowings are a few highlights:\n",
    "* Create precise prompts. Provide contextual information, speficy the output format and style, and provide clear prompt sections.\n",
    "* Use system propmts to define how the model will repond.\n",
    "* Give Amazon Nova time to think. For example, add ```\"Think step-by-step.\"``` at the end of your query.\n",
    "* Provide examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for using prompts in RAG\n",
    "* Provide Prompt Template: As with other functionalities, enhancing the system prompt can be beneficial. You can define the RAG Systems description in the system prompt, outlining the desired persona and behavior for the model.\n",
    "* Use Model Instructions: Additionally, you can include a dedicated ```\"Model Instructions:\"``` section within the system prompt, where you can provide specific guidelines for the model to follow. For instance, you can list instructions such as: ```In this example session, the model has access to search results and a user's question, its job is to answer the user's question using only information from the search results.```\n",
    "* Avoid Hallucination by restricting the instructions: Bring more focus to instructions by clearly mentioning \"DO NOT USE INFORMATION THAT IS NOT IN SEARCH RESULTS!\" as a model instruction so the answers are grounded in the provided context.\n"
